Here’s a structured breakdown of the story you shared — “Explore Dataplex Capabilities for Data Extraction from CAO GCP Data Platforms” — with suggested points for each scenario. I’ve mapped out the capabilities of Dataplex on the Google Cloud platform (GCP) that you can evaluate and present under each scenario. You can adapt them to your CAO GCP data-platform context.


---

Scenario 1: Identify Dataplex data-discovery capabilities

Given Dataplex is deployed in a test GCP environment
When I use Dataplex to scan a sample CAO GCP data source
Then Dataplex should successfully discover the data assets and metadata

Suggested points to gather:

Asset discovery: Dataplex’s catalog automatically discovers and inventories metadata for supported assets (e.g., BigQuery tables, Cloud Storage filesets, Cloud SQL, etc) across projects and regions. 

Metadata ingestion: It supports automatic ingestion of technical metadata (schema, table metadata) and you can bring in business/operational metadata (tags, glossaries) to enrich the catalog. 

Search / discovery: Dataplex provides a unified semantic search / faceted search across the catalog to find assets across silos/locations. 

Organising domain/zone: With Dataplex you can define lakes/zones/assets (for example for your CAO GCP platform) and logically organize domains/teams for discovery. 

Support for diverse sources: It covers BigQuery, Cloud Storage, Cloud SQL, Bigtable, etc. 

Metadata enrichment & governance context: You can attach business glossary terms, ownership, domain, sensitivity to catalog entries. 

Example metrics you can evaluate: number of assets discovered, time to discover, % of assets enriched with business metadata, search latency, coverage of CAO data sources.


Possible caveats / things to check:

Are all of your CAO GCP data sources supported out-of-the-box by Dataplex, or will some require custom ingestion? (third-party or on-prem).

The scanning frequency/latency for newly created assets — is it near-real-time, or a periodic job?

The level of metadata captured for non-BigQuery sources (for example raw files in Cloud Storage) might differ.

Permissions: Ensure that the identity under which Dataplex runs has access to scan the sample source.

Scenario 2: Evaluate Dataplex data-quality features

Given Dataplex is connected to a sample CAO GCP data source
When I configure data quality rules in Dataplex
Then Dataplex should validate the data against the defined rules and report any data-quality issues

Suggested points:

Data Profiling: Dataplex supports data profiling to infer statistics (e.g., distributions, null rates) which helps generate rule recommendations. 

Auto Data Quality (managed): Dataplex allows definition of quality rules (pre-built types or custom SQL), schedules scans, and reports failures/alerts. 

Legacy Data Quality Tasks: There is also the YAML/SQL rule approach (Data Quality Tasks) you might encounter if your team already used it. 

Rule types: completeness (null check), uniqueness, range checks, regex checks, custom SQL expressions. 

Execution and monitoring: Ability to schedule scans (incremental or full), capture results, view pass/fail metrics per rule/column, integrate with Cloud Logging/alerts. 

Integration into pipelines: You could trigger quality scans as part of your data ingestion / transformation workflow (which seems relevant given your data-engineer role).

Governance of data quality: You can attach quality metrics, scores, and status to the catalog metadata so downstream users see trusted/untrusted datasets.


Possible evaluation checklist items for CAO context:

Define sample datasets/tables in CAO GCP platform to apply rules.

Identify baseline rules relevant to CAO (e.g., completeness of key columns, valid ranges for financial data, uniqueness of transaction IDs etc) and configure them.

Run a scan and capture results: number of rules passed/failed, detail of failures, trend analysis.

Alerting/reporting: how easy is it for your operations team to get notifications?

Cost/performance: consider the scan cost/time (especially large tables).

Governance: associate quality outcomes with metadata in the catalog – e.g., annotate a dataset as “trusted” if it passes quality, else “needs review”.

Scenario 3: Assess Dataplex data-governance features

Given Dataplex is set up with data governance policies
When I attempt to access a restricted data asset through Dataplex
Then Dataplex should enforce the data governance policies and restrict access accordingly

Suggested points:

Metadata & policy centralisation: Dataplex centralises metadata and offers unified governance across lakes/warehouses/silos. 

Access control / IAM: The catalog uses IAM roles, and Dataplex supports custom constraints/policies to manage who can view/discover/consume assets. 

Data lineage: Ability to capture end-to-end lineage (from source through transformations) so you know where data came from and what transformations it underwent — important for governance and audit. 

Data classification & domains: Attach classification (e.g., sensitive, PII) tags/glossaries, assign ownership, establish domains/teams. 

Policy enforcement across open lakehouse: For example with BigLake/Apache Iceberg integration, Dataplex ensures policies propagate across engines. 

Audit and monitoring: Logging of metadata access, change history, lineage, quality metrics — supporting compliance. 

Data domains and mesh: Supports domain-centric governance, enabling decentralised ownership but central monitoring. 


Evaluation checklist for CAO context:

Define a sample restricted asset in CAO (say sensitive PII or regulated data).

Use Dataplex to assign classification (sensitive), assign owner/team, set access policy.

Attempt access via a user without permission and verify enforcement.

Review lineage for that asset to demonstrate traceability.

Review audit logs (who accessed, when, what meta-changes).

Validate whether policies propagate automatically and uniformly across data sources/silos.

Consider how governance integrates with your existing CAO GCP controls (e.g., IAM, Data Loss Prevention, etc).

Scenario 4: Document findings and recommendations

Given the exploration of Dataplex capabilities is complete
When I summarise the findings and recommendations
Then I should produce a document outlining the potential benefits and limitations of using Dataplex for data extraction from CAO GCP Data Platforms

Suggested points for the report:

Benefits

Discovery: Faster time to find/data-on-board assets, improved metadata visibility.

Trust & quality: Automated profiling and rule-based data quality checks improve trust in data.

Governance: Unified catalogue, lineage, policy enforcement leads to better control of data assets.

Democratization: Business users can search, understand and use assets confidently.

Efficiency: Reduced manual metadata capture, fewer silos, fewer governance blind spots.


Limitations / Considerations

Coverage: Some on-prem or non-GCP sources may require custom ingestion or may not be fully covered.

Cost/Performance: Scans and cataloging jobs incur compute/storage cost; need sizing/monitoring.

Maturity: Some features (e.g., AutoDQ) may be newer and you may need to check GA status in your region. 

Organizational readiness: Need metadata culture, defined ownership, governance processes to reap full benefits.

Integration: Must align with existing CAO GCP security, data-platform pipelines, ingestion frameworks.

Change management: Users may need training to leverage catalog/discovery; processes will shift.


Recommendations

Pilot on a representative CAO GCP domain: e.g., financial transactions, customer analytics.

Define metadata standards and business glossary for CAO context ahead of cataloging.

Establish governance roles (data-owners, stewards) and integrate Dataplex results into your current data-platform operating model.

Schedule regular data quality scans for critical datasets, with thresholds and alerting.

Monitor cost/performance of scans and adjust sampling/incremental strategies.

Integrate lineage and catalog metadata into your dashboards or audit reports for tracking.

Plan for scaling: as you scale across data domains, how will lakes/zones/assets be structured.

Review existing pipelines (you as a data engineer working on ingest & transformations) and see how Dataplex can be embedded (e.g., via Airflow, Cloud Composer) into the ETL/ELT flows.

If you like, I can prepare a slide-ready document (in PowerPoint or Google Slides format) that aligns with your story’s acceptance criteria, with all these bullets and a section for CAO-specific mapping (since you’re working in that environment). Would you like me to pull that together?
