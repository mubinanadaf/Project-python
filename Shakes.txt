Hamlet — Act I, Scene I (Opening Passages)

BERNARDO:
Who's there?

FRANCISCO:
Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.

BERNARDO:
Long live the king!

FRANCISCO:
Bernardo?

BERNARDO:
He.

FRANCISCO:
You come most carefully upon your hour.

BERNARDO:
'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.

FRANCISCO:
For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
And I am sick at heart.
