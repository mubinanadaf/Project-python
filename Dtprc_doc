⭐ If Dataproc Serverless manages the VM automatically, then why do we need Spark properties?

Because:

✔ We don't control infrastructure (VM types, nodes, cluster)

BUT

✔ We DO control the Spark runtime behavior inside the serverless environment

Think of it like this:

Serverless = Google chooses the machines

Spark properties = YOU choose how Spark uses those machines


So Spark properties still matter — a lot.
